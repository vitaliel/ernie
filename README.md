Ernie
=====

By Tom Preston-Werner (tom@mojombo.com)

Ernie is a BERT-RPC server implementation that uses an Erlang server to accept incoming connections, and then delegates the request to Ruby handlers.

See the full BERT-RPC specification at [bert-rpc.org](http://bert-rpc.org).

Ernie currently supports the following BERT-RPC features:

* `call` requests
* `cast` requests

Ernie was developed for GitHub and is currently in production use serving millions of RPC requests every day. The stability and performance have been exemplary.


Installation
------------

You must have Erlang installed before installing Ernie.

    $ gem install ernie -s http://gemcutter.org


Running
-------

    Usage: ernie [command] [options]
        -h, --handler HANDLER            Handler file
        -p, --port PORT                  Port
        -n, --number NUMBER              Number of handler instances
        -d, --detached                   Run as a daemon
        -P, --pidfile PIDFILE            Location to write pid file.

    Commands:
      <none>                Start an Ernie server.
      reload-handlers       Gracefully reload all of the the ruby handlers
                            and use the new code for all subsequent requests.
      stats                 Print a list of connection and handler statistics.

    Examples:
      ernie -d -p 9999 -n 10 -h calc.rb
        Start the ernie server in the background on port 9999 with ten
        handlers, using the calc.rb handler file.

      ernie reload-handlers -p 9999
        Reload the handlers for the ernie server currently running on
        port 9999.

Example Handler
---------------

Using a Ruby module and Ernie.expose:

    require 'ernie'
    
    module Calc
      def add(a, b)
        a + b
      end
    end
    
    Ernie.expose(:calc, Calc)
    
Using the DSL (this will be deprecated in a future release):

    require 'ernie'

    mod(:calc) do
      fun(:add) do |a, b|
        a + b
      end
    end


Logging
-------

You can have logging sent to a file by adding these lines to your handler:

    logfile('/var/log/ernie.log')
    loglevel(Logger::INFO)

This will log startup info, requests, and error messages to the log. Choosing
Logger::DEBUG will include the response (be careful, doing this can generate
very large log files).


Autostart
---------

Normally Ernie handlers will become active after the file has been loaded in.
you can disable this behavior by setting:

    Ernie.auto_start = false


Example BERT-RPC call for above example
---------------------------------------

    -> {call, calc, add, [1, 2]}

    <- {reply, 3}


Using the BERTRPC gem to make calls to Ernie
--------------------------------------------

You can make BERT-RPC calls from Ruby with the [BERTRPC gem](http://github.com/mojombo/bertrpc):

    require 'bertrpc'

    svc = BERTRPC::Service.new('localhost', 8000)
    svc.call.calc.add(1, 2)
    # => 3

Known Issues
------------
* Streaming does not work with erlang from debian lenny, but works with erlang-nox package from testing: 1:13.b.2.1-dfsg-1 version works fine. See [this message](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/ruby-code-browser/messages/a_KnM41QOr3OfueJe5aVNr) for more details.

Contribute
----------

If you'd like to hack on Ernie, start by forking my repo on GitHub:

    http://github.com/mojombo/ernie

To get all of the dependencies, install the gem first. To run ernie from
source, you must first build the Erlang code:

    rake ebuild

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
1. Create a topic branch to contain your change
1. Hack away
1. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `rake`
1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README.md
1. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end
1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
1. Push the branch up to GitHub
1. Send me (mojombo) a pull request for your branch
